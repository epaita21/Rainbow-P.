Green
Blue
Red
Yellow
Orange
Purple
Pink
These are the colors of the Rainbow
No arc will be perfect than that rainbow
Is there no way to think rainbows are not beautiful
The bright colors exploiting in the bue light sky 
will never compare to her eyes
Green like the peace of the way it all makes the surroundings be unseen.
Blue like the way peddals conforts a flower as it blooms.
